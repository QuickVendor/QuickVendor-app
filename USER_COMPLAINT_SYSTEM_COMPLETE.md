### 🧪 Current Testing Status

#### Development Server
- ✅ Running at: http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Build process verified
- ✅ Dependencies installed (@sentry/react, lucide-react)

#### Manual Testing Required
1. **Visual Verification**
   - Look for floating help button in bottom-right corner
   - Click button to open complaint modal
   - Test all complaint categories and priorities

2. **Sentry Event Verification**
   - Submit test complaints
   - Check Sentry dashboard for events
   - Verify proper tagging and context

3. **Slack Notification Testing**
   - Submit urgent complaints → immediate alerts
   - Submit bug reports → development team notifications
   - Submit feature requests → product team alerts
   - Submit general help → support team notifications

### 📊 Expected Sentry Events

For each complaint submission:
```json
{
  "type": "user_feedback",
  "user": {
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "tags": {
    "user_complaint": "true",
    "complaint_category": "bug|feature|help|urgent",
    "complaint_priority": "low|medium|high|urgent",
    "page_route": "/current-page"
  },
  "contexts": {
    "complaint_details": {
      "category": "bug",
      "priority": "high",
      "url": "http://localhost:5173",
      "userAgent": "...",
      "viewport": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080},
      "timestamp": "2025-08-07T..."
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔔 Slack Alert Configuration

Your existing Slack-Sentry integration should trigger notifications based on:

1. **Urgent Issues**: `user_complaint:true AND complaint_priority:urgent`
2. **Bug Reports**: `user_complaint:true AND complaint_category:bug`  
3. **All Complaints**: `user_complaint:true`

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the System**: Visit http://localhost:5173 and test the complaint flow
2. **Verify Sentry Events**: Check your Sentry dashboard for complaint events
3. **Confirm Slack Alerts**: Verify notifications appear in configured channels
4. **Production Deployment**: System is ready for production once testing is complete

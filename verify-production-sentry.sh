echo -e "\n📊 SENTRY MONITORING CAPABILITIES:"
echo "✅ Error Monitoring - Real-time error capture and alerts"
echo "✅ Performance Tracking - API response time and database query monitoring"  
echo "✅ User Context - Track errors by authenticated users"
echo "✅ Request Breadcrumbs - Full request context for debugging"
echo "✅ Custom Error Context - Business logic error capture"
echo "✅ Production Sampling - Optimized for production load"

# üö® CRITICAL: AWS S3 Setup for Render

## The Problem
Your S3 image uploads are NOT working in production because AWS credentials are not configured in Render.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Get Your AWS Credentials
You already have these locally. Run this command to see them:
```bash
cd backend
cat .env | grep AWS
```

You need:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (starts with AKIA...)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (long secret string)

### 2. Add to Render Dashboard

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your service: **quickvendor-backend**
3. Click on **"Environment"** tab on the left
4. Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
5. Add these two variables:

   | Key | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | (paste your key starting with AKIA...) |
   | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | (paste your secret key) |

6. Click **"Save Changes"**
7. Service will automatically redeploy

### 3. Verify It's Working

After deployment (takes ~5 minutes), check:

1. Go to: https://quickvendor-app.onrender.com/api/health
2. Look for this in the response:
```json
{
  "s3": {
    "configured": true,  // ‚úÖ Should be TRUE
    "boto3_available": true,  // ‚úÖ Should be TRUE
    "boto3_version": "1.40.7",
    "bucket": "quickvendor-products",
    "region": "eu-north-1"
  }
}
```

### 4. Test Upload
Try uploading a product with images. The images should now appear in your S3 bucket!

## Why This Happened

The `render.yaml` has `sync: false` for AWS credentials:
```yaml
- key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  sync: false  # This means manual setup required!
- key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  sync: false  # This means manual setup required!
```

This is for security - AWS credentials should never be committed to git.

## Still Not Working?

If after adding credentials it still shows `configured: false`, try:

1. **Clear Build Cache** in Render:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Clear build cache
   - Trigger manual deploy

2. **Check the logs** for errors:
   - Look for "boto3 not available"
   - Look for "S3 not configured"

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ boto3 is in requirements-production.txt
- ‚úÖ S3 code is fixed and working
- ‚ùå AWS credentials need to be added to Render
- ‚ùå Environment variable shows "unknown" (should show "production")

Once you add the AWS credentials, everything will work!

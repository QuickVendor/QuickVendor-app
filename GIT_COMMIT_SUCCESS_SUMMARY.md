ðŸ”’ Fix mobile authentication: Replace localStorage with secure HTTP-only cookies

PROBLEM SOLVED:
- Vendors were getting logged out on mobile devices every time they refreshed pages
- localStorage was unreliable on mobile browsers and posed security risks
- Poor user experience with constant re-authentication required

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
âœ… Backend Changes:
- Add HTTP-only secure cookie support in login endpoint (/api/auth/login)
- Implement logout endpoint (/api/auth/logout) for proper cookie cleanup
- Enhanced authentication dependency to read tokens from cookies OR headers
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API clients

âœ… Frontend Changes:
- Remove all localStorage token dependencies
- Update API configuration to include credentials for cookie support
- Refactor authentication flow to rely on server-set cookies
- Update ProtectedRoute to verify auth via API instead of localStorage
- Simplify logout process using new backend endpoint

âœ… Security Improvements:
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS token theft
- Secure flag ensures HTTPS-only transmission in production
- SameSite=lax prevents CSRF attacks
- 7-day automatic expiration with proper cleanup

âœ… Mobile Compatibility:
- Cookies persist across mobile browser sessions and refreshes
- Cross-tab authentication synchronization
- Reliable authentication state management
- No more logout issues on page refresh

FILES MODIFIED:
Backend:
- backend/app/api/auth.py: Cookie authentication and logout endpoint
- backend/app/api/deps.py: Enhanced token extraction with cookie support

Frontend:
- frontend/src/config/api.ts: Cookie-based API configuration
- frontend/src/components/AuthPage.tsx: Remove localStorage usage
- frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx: API-based auth verification
- frontend/src/components/VendorDashboard.tsx: Updated logout and API calls

TESTING:
- âœ… Authentication persists across page refreshes
- âœ… Mobile browser compatibility verified
- âœ… Cross-tab authentication sync works
- âœ… Secure cookie flags properly set
- âœ… Logout properly clears authentication state

This fix resolves the mobile authentication issues and provides enhanced
security while maintaining a seamless user experience across all devices.

## üß™ **HOW TO TEST SENTRY INTEGRATION**

### **Backend Testing**
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Test Sentry message capture
curl http://localhost:8001/api/sentry/test-message

# Test Sentry error capture  
curl http://localhost:8001/api/sentry/test-error
```

### **Frontend Testing**
1. Visit: http://localhost:5174
2. Login/Register to access dashboard
3. Find the **"üß™ Sentry Testing (Development Only)"** yellow panel
4. Click various test buttons to verify Sentry features

### **Automated Testing**
```bash
# Run comprehensive test
./test-sentry-integration.sh
```

## üìä **WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN SENTRY**

With the DSNs you have configured, Sentry will capture:

### **Backend Events**
- API errors with full request context
- Database query performance
- User authentication events
- Product creation and management analytics
- Custom business intelligence events

### **Frontend Events**
- JavaScript errors with user context
- Page performance and Core Web Vitals
- User session recordings (session replay)
- Route transition performance
- User interaction tracking

---

## üéØ **FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

### **What You Need to Do**

1. **Create Production Sentry Projects**:
   - Go to https://sentry.io
   - Create **2 separate projects**:
     - Frontend: React/JavaScript project
     - Backend: Python/FastAPI project

2. **Update Render Environment Variables**:

   **Frontend Service**:
   ```env
   VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-production-frontend-dsn@org.ingest.sentry.io/project-id
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
   VITE_NODE_ENV=production
   ```

   **Backend Service**:
   ```env
   SENTRY_DSN=https://your-production-backend-dsn@org.ingest.sentry.io/project-id
   SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
   SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
   ```

3. **Deploy and Monitor**:
   - Both services will automatically start sending events to Sentry
   - Check your Sentry dashboard for real-time error monitoring
